00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,800
 Just unmute the event directly, right?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,720
 Just what?

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,839
 OK, so the thing responsible for sending data to the front end.

00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,320
 Is this particular line socket?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,320
 Yeah.
